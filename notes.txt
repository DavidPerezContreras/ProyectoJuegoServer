/*

In Node.js, there are several built-in events that can be triggered by different types of objects. Here are some of the most common events in Node.js:

'close': This event is emitted when a server or a socket is closed.
'connect': This event is emitted when a client socket successfully connects to a server.
'data': This event is emitted when a socket receives data.
'disconnect': This event is emitted when a client socket is disconnected from a server.
'end': This event is emitted when a socket ends its reading process.
'error': This event is emitted when an error occurs.
'listening': This event is emitted when a server starts listening for incoming connections.
'message': This event is emitted when a child process sends a message to its parent process.
'timeout': This event is emitted when a socket times out due to inactivity.
These are just a few examples of the many events available in Node.js. Different objects in Node.js may emit different events depending on their functionality.
